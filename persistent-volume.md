## Why we need persistent volume ?

**Problem**:

`data will be loss on pod restart`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ded3cf09-52e1-4aa3-ad8c-2b013421b367)

**Solution**:

`so you need that storage that does not depend on pod lifecycle`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84f391cf-32db-49c5-b767-9d74b514e2b6)



If you have multiple pods across different nodes then storage (with up to date data) must be available/accessible from all the nodes.

Storage outside kubernetes cluster:

another use case where you should have persitent volume:
its not only specific to databases;

## Local Storage Vs Remote Storage:

## How to create/define persistent volume:

its a kubernetes resource object defined via YAML. but it is an abstract component - means it need some physical storage. like

local hard driver from the cluster nodes.
External NFS Servers outside kubernetes cluster.
Cloud Storage , AWS, Azure etc

## NameSpace - Relation

PV are not namespace-specific - it can be used across all namespaces.
BUT pvc and pod should be exist in the same namespace

Storage Administrator = provision PV
Application Administrator = provisiong PVC
application has to claim the persitent volume

**Flow**:

### Persistent Volume Claim (PVC:
When you define PVC you define required specs of volume ; like desired storage space,access mode.

Whatever PV matches criteria or satisfies the claim will be used for the application.

### How ot works !
`A single PersistentVolume (PV) can only be bound to one PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) at a time`.

- When a PVC is created, Kubernetes searches for a matching PV.

- Once it binds the PVC to a PV, that PV is marked as ‚ÄúBound‚Äù and cannot be claimed again.

### How to Bound PVC with POD:

- POD requests the Volume through PV Claim.

### Levels of Volume abstractions;

- POD requests the Volume through PV Claim.
- Claim tries to find a volume in the cluster
- which PV satisfies the claim - volume has the actual backend storage.

### mounting with multiple containers of same POD

If you have multiple containers within the same POD, you will need to mount volume explicitly with all containers according to your requirement.


### Different Volume Types in a single POD:

# Storage Class:

‚öôÔ∏è **Dynamic provisioning** : `SC provisions persistent volumes dynamically.` \
     --------------------------------------------------------------------->  `When PersistentVolumeClaim claim it`

A StorageClass is a blueprint or template that tells Kubernetes how to dynamically provision PersistentVolumes (PVs) when a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is created.

Instead of pre-creating PVs manually, StorageClasses automate the creation of storage using a specific backend (like Azure Disk, AWS EBS, NFS, etc.).

## Access Modes:
| Access Mode     | Description                         | Multiple Pods    | Multiple PVCs |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| `ReadWriteOnce` | Mounted as R/W by **one node only** | ‚úÖ (on same node) | ‚ùå             |
| `ReadOnlyMany`  | Mounted as ReadOnly by many nodes   | ‚úÖ                | ‚ùå             |
| `ReadWriteMany` | Mounted as R/W by many nodes        | ‚úÖ                | ‚ùå             |


## üìê Matching Conditions Between PVC and PV (for static provisioning)

Kubernetes uses the following fields to match a PVC to an existing PV:
| PVC Field                    | Must match with PV Field                            |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `storageClassName`           | `storageClassName`                                  |
| `accessModes`                | Must be **subset** of PV's                          |
| `resources.requests.storage` | PV‚Äôs `capacity.storage` must be **equal or larger** |
| `volumeMode` (optional)      | Must match if specified                             |
| `selector` (optional)        | Matches labels on PV                                |


üß™ Example: PVC requesting a PV

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
  storageClassName: ""


PV (manually created):


```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: my-volume
  labels:
    type: local
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: ""
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
```

‚úÖ What happens:
accessModes: match ‚úÖ

storage: 10Gi ‚â• 5Gi ‚úÖ

storageClassName: both are empty (no dynamic provisioning) ‚úÖ

‚Üí Kubernetes binds the PVC to the PV.


üí° What if StorageClassName is defined?
Then it uses dynamic provisioning:

```bash
storageClassName: standard
```
- If no matching PV exists, Kubernetes uses the StorageClass definition to provision a new PV dynamically.

- The new PV is then bound to the PVC.

üîÑ **One-Time Binding**

Once a PV is bound to a PVC, it cannot be reused by another PVC unless:

The PVC is deleted,

And the PV‚Äôs reclaimPolicy is set to Retain or manually reset to Available.


## üîç Matching Diagram (Text-Based)

```bash
PVC
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ storage: 5Gi
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ accessModes: RWO
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ storageClassName: "fast"

     ‚¨á

Kubernetes:
  - Finds existing PV with ‚â•5Gi, RWO, "fast"
  - OR dynamically provisions using StorageClass "fast"
     ‚¨á

PV is Bound to PVC

```

**Summary**:


| Component           | Condition                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Access Modes        | PVC must be subset of PV   |
| Storage Size        | PV must be equal or larger |
| Storage Class       | Must match exactly         |
| Selector (optional) | Matches labels on PV       |
