# Liveness and Readness Probe

In Kubernetes, `liveness` and `readiness` probes are used to monitor the health and availability of containers ( or application running inside the container).
While they may seem similar, they serve different purposes and have different effects on how Kubernetes manages pods.



`Kubelet monitors the liveness and readiness prob (Health Monitoring`



# ‚úÖ Use Case Examples:

**1. Liveness Probe Use Case**
Suppose you have a Node.js application that sometimes enters an infinite loop or deadlock. Kubernetes needs to restart the container if it stops responding.

```bash
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 3000
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5

```
**üß† Explanation:**

- Kubernetes hits /healthz on port 3000 every 5 seconds.

- If the endpoint doesn't return a 200 OK, Kubernetes assumes the app is dead and restarts the container.

**2. Readiness Probe Use Case:**


Let‚Äôs imagine that your app takes a minute to warm up and start. Your service won‚Äôt work until it is up and running, even though the process has started. You will also have issues if you want to scale up this deployment to have multiple copies. A new copy shouldn‚Äôt receive traffic until it is fully ready, but by default Kubernetes starts sending it traffic as soon as the process inside the container starts. By using a readiness probe, Kubernetes waits until the app is fully started before it allows the service to send traffic to the new copy.

Imagine a web app takes 30 seconds to initialize, load configs, or warm up before it can accept traffic. You don‚Äôt want it to receive requests before it‚Äôs ready.


```bash

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 3000
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5

```

**üß† Explanation:**

- Kubernetes checks /ready every 5 seconds.

- If the probe fails, Kubernetes removes the pod from the Service endpoint list, and it won‚Äôt receive traffic.

- Once the endpoint returns 200 OK, the pod will start receiving traffic.

# **‚öôÔ∏è Combining Both Probes**

```bash

livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 15
  periodSeconds: 20

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 10

```

**üß† Effect:**

- Liveness keeps the container alive and restarts it when frozen.

- Readiness ensures it only receives traffic when it's ready to handle it.

# Liveness Probe - checks if the container is alive, restarts if fails:

          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /healthz
              port: 8080

            failureThreshold: 3             # failureThreshold:  Number of failures before action is taken.

# Readiness Probe - checks if the app is ready to serve traffic:

            readinessProbe:

                port: 8080

**üìù Notes:**
You must configure the app to respond on /healthz and /ready with HTTP 200 when healthy/ready.




## Startup Probe:

`startupProbe` is important for containers that take a long time to start. It prevents Kubernetes from killing the container too early during its startup phase.

When you only use a livenessProbe, Kubernetes starts checking if the app is alive immediately. If your app takes, say, 60 seconds to start up‚Äîbut your livenessProbe times out after 30 seconds‚ÄîKubernetes assumes the app is unhealthy and restarts it, over and over again.

üß® This creates a loop where the app never gets a chance to fully start.

**When startupProbe is defined:** 

- Kubernetes uses only the startupProbe to check if the app has started.

- If startupProbe succeeds, then livenessProbe takes over.

- If it fails for too long (based on failureThreshold and periodSeconds), the container is considered failed to start, and it‚Äôs killed.


**Example:**

‚Üí ` This gives the app up to 30 √ó 5 = 150 seconds to become healthy before Kubernetes kills it.`


```bash

startupProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
  failureThreshold: 30
  periodSeconds: 5

```

**üß† When to Use startupProbe**
**Use it when:**

- Your app initializes slowly (e.g., compiles code, loads models, connects to DBs).

- You‚Äôve experienced containers being restarted during startup.

- You want better separation of startup logic and liveness checks.
