### ConfigMap

# What is ConfigMap:

A ConfigMap is a Kubernetes object used to store non-confidential configuration data in key-value pairs. It decouples environment-specific configuration from container images, making your apps more portable, flexible, and manageable.



🔧 Real Use Cases: for ConfigMap:
- Store app-level config like database URLs, app modes (dev, prod), or feature toggles.
- Share environment variables with pods.
- Inject configuration files (e.g., .conf, .ini, .json) into containers.
